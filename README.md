### LAMBEQ：Quantum + Natural language process

LAMBEQ was created to explore the structural correspondences between the matching compositional structures underpinning quantum theory, structures such as process theories and tensor networks, with formal and natural languages to design novel models for language and other cognitive phenomena. An open-source, modular, extensible high-level Python software library, enables the design and implementation of end-to-end QNLP pipelines that seamlessly integrate with Quantinuum’s platform-agnostic compiler, TKET™.
